          Early History of Computer One of the earliest and most well-known
          devices was an abacus. Then in 1822, the father of computers, Charles
          Babbage began developing what would be the first mechanical computer.
          And then in 1833 he actually designed an Analytical Engine which was a
          general-purpose computer. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur,

          The presentation of the Edison Effect in 1885 provided the theoretical
          background for electronic devices. Originally in the form of vacuum
          tubes, electronic components were rapidly integrated into electric
          devices, revolutionizing radio and later television. It was in
          computers however, where the full impact of electronics was felt.
          Analog computers used to calculate ballistics were crucial to the
          outcome of World War II, and the Colossus and the ENIAC, the two
          earliest electronic digital computers, were developed during the war.

          For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can
          consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard
          methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1]
          Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or
          contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job
          positions such as a graphic designer or information systems
          technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between
          departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
          are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer,
          back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers
          are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
          while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the
          commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become
          one of the most used technologies ever.
